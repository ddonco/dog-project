## Project Overview

This project focuses on building, training, and using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). To motivate the use of a CNN, we aim to build an algorithm that returns a predicted dog breed when supplied with an image of a dog. Additionally, the algorithm can take in an image of a human face and return the breed of dog that the face most closely resembles. The Jupyter Notebook file dog_app.ipynb walks through an exploration of building a simple CNN for dog breed classification. Next, we employ transfer learning to combine a sophisticated, pretrained model with added top layers to improve the results of the dog breed app.
